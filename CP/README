O.- Preparation of the "multispec_sol" simulation
a) Run "multispec_sol" to prepare the scripts and folders

1.- Preparation of the solute geom in gaussian (in gaussian folder)
a) Geom opt and Freq with DFT, a few explicit solvent molecs and PCM
b) Delete water and compute ESP charges
c) ./gaus2car.sh to produce initial car file for Mat St from the gaussian charges log
#d) ./gaus2optxyz.sh to extract the optimized xyz geom from opt+freq gaussian log 

2.- NX (in newtonX folder)
a) Create NX Wigner geoms and remove waters
a.1) convert_nx_xyz.sh using the opt+freq gaussian log (explicit solvent will be removed and numbering added)

3.- Mat Studio
Forcefield: Dreiding
Water charges: SPC
-For box of solvent: 
a) Box of 20x20x20 (images of solute atoms at > 15 Angs)
b) Amorphous cell + Packing to fill box with solvent molecules (density 1 gr/mL)
c) Dynamics NVT 1 ns with fixed gaussian geom and ESP charges (25 snapshots taken after 370 ps)
-Only for surface:
a) Amorphous cell + construction (20x20x20: images of solute atoms at > 15 Angs; density 1 gr/mL)
b) Box of 20x20x60
c) Dynamics NVT 1 ns of the surface (5 geoms are taken after 370 ps)
d) Adsorption Locator at each one of the snapshots to get the lowest 5 configurations (in total 25 car)

4.- Wigner geoms inserted in car files
a) ./extractQM_from_car.sh
b) ./lstrans_Wign2xyzMatSt.sh  # Wigner geoms from gaussian + NX are in fromNX folder
c) ./Wign2car.sh

5.- Mat Studio
a) Dynamics NVT 5 ps with fixed Wigner QM geoms and ESP charges (100 car)

6.- car files to xyz and XFiled for spectra
a) ./out2incell.sh  # Move out cell waters to the main cell, add neighbour cells and select a sphere of 20 Angs around solute
(QM xyz and XField is generated)

7.- cross section programs
