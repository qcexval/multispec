# multispec

Software for predicting absorption electronic spectra with multiconfigurational quantum chemistry. 
There are two options:
- [GP] Gas phase absorption spectroscopy. It includes:
  - Ground and excited state absorption spectra
  - Espontaneous emission
  - Stimulated emission
  - Transient absorption spectrum
- [CP] Molar extinction coefficients of chromophores in condensed phases (in solution, at interfaces or surfaces, embeded in proteins or nucleic acids, etc.)
